# 🏨 HotelBookingSystem

An AI-powered hotel booking system with React.js frontend, ASP.NET Core backend, and Ocelot API Gateway. Features include AI hotel search by city, dates, people; hotel listing with rooms and discounted prices; comments and rating system using MongoDB; booking reservations with automatic capacity decrement; email notifications when room capacity falls below 20%; and a microservices architecture managed via Ocelot gateway.

Built with React.js (frontend), ASP.NET Core Web API (backend), MySQL for hotels/rooms/bookings/users, MongoDB for comments, Ocelot for API Gateway, and SMTP for notification emails.
